# Stereomato's NixOS setup
My NixOS + home-manager setup.

My previous user only (home-manager) is [here](https://github.com/stereomato/user-setup)

I'm still figuring out organization, but I try to keep the stuff in the `hardware` section as stuff that *MUST* work. As for stuff in the users directory, it's anything that can be applied on top of each the hardware system.
